,SIENNA,NEUTRAL,"""I live in Harminee and although the prices for electricity aren't super high, it would be helpful if it could be further reduced, as in my neighbourhood people are constantly trying to make ends meet."""
,YOU,NEUTRAL,"""Oh, Harminee? I actually worked on that project,"""
,YOU,NEUTRAL,"""My objective for that project was to reduce the cost as much as I could, but at the same time ensuring that I was being environmentally consious, that is why you might find the prices a bit high."""

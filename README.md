You play as the Chief Energy Coordinator of Big Energy Corp., tasked with the duty of determining which sources of energy power new up-and-coming residential districts.
Be careful how you choose to energize the power grid, as the decisions you make will impact the outcome of the game and change the world for better or for worse.

The game consists of two main parts:
A visual novel consisting of dialogue between employees and family of You, the protagonist
A puzzle mechanic featuring a grid-system and Tetris-like game pieces.
